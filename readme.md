Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Junior!
ðŸ§  I'm trying to learn JS right now, although I'll learn something different if I need/want to.
ðŸŒŽ I currently live in the US, and that's not going to change ANY time soon.
ðŸ’» I'm on a computer 90% of my life, so if you want to talk to me, just add me on discord! juniorlol#0001
